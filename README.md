## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.11+** installed on your system
- **8GB+ RAM** (recommended for model training)
- **CUDA-compatible GPU** (optional, but speeds up training significantly)

### ⚙️ **Running on a New Device: Step-by-Step Guide**

Here's exactly how to get the Egypt Tourism Assistant running on a new machine.

#### **Step 1: Get the Code**

First, clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fine-tune-Serve-a-Small-Language-Model.git
cd Fine-tune-Serve-a-Small-Language-Model
```

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Python Environment**

Next, create an isolated Python environment to keep dependencies organized. This ensures the project runs smoothly without interfering with other Python projects.

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install all required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### **Step 3: Run the Pre-trained Model**

You can immediately start the API server to use the pre-trained model included in the project. This allows you to test the application without needing to train the model yourself.

```bash
python main.py serve
```

#### **Step 4: Test the API**

Once the server is running, you can interact with your AI assistant in several ways:

1.  **Interactive Docs**: Open a web browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs**. This interface lets you test all API endpoints directly.
2.  **Run the Benchmark**: Use the built-in benchmark command to evaluate the model's performance.
    ```bash
    python main.py benchmark
    ```

#### **Step 5: (Optional) Re-train the Model**

If you want to fine-tune the model yourself with new data or different settings, you can run the full training pipeline:

```bash
python main.py train
```

This will overwrite the existing model in the `models/` directory with your newly trained version.

### 1. Environment Setup

First, let's set up a clean Python environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Fine-tune-Serve-a-Small-Language-Model

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Optional: HuggingFace Token Setup

While not required for the base functionality, setting up a HuggingFace token enables access to additional models:

```bash
python scripts/setup_token.py
```

### 3. Quick Demo - Use the Pre-trained Model

Want to see the assistant in action immediately? Start the API server:

```bash
python main.py serve
```

Then visit:
- **API Interface**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- **Try it out**: Ask questions like "What are the best attractions in Egypt?"

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Data Collection

Our journey begins with gathering high-quality, Egypt-specific tourism data:

```bash
# Collect data from web sources and PDFs
python scripts/run_data_collection.py

# Analyze what we collected
python scripts/analyze_results.py
```

**What happens here:**
- Scrapes Egyptian tourism content from Wikipedia and government websites
- Extracts information from PDF travel guides
- Generates question-answer pairs from the collected content
- Stores everything with proper metadata and source attribution

### Step 2: Data Processing

Raw data needs refinement before it can train our model effectively:

```bash
# Clean and enhance the collected data
python scripts/process_data.py

# Validate data quality
python scripts/validate_processed_data.py
```

**What happens here:**
- Removes duplicates and low-quality content
- Enhances text with proper formatting and language detection
- Creates training-ready datasets in multiple formats (Alpaca, chat)
- Splits data into training, validation, and test sets

### Step 3: Model Training

Now we fine-tune our language model on the Egypt tourism data:

```bash
# Start the fine-tuning process
python main.py train

# Check training setup beforehand (optional)
python scripts/check_training_setup.py
```

**What happens here:**
- Loads a pre-trained language model (Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat, 500M parameters)
- Applies LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning (8M trainable parameters)
- Trains the model on our Egypt tourism dataset (62 Q&A pairs)
- Saves the fine-tuned model for deployment

### Step 4: Model Evaluation

Let's see how much our fine-tuning improved the model:

```bash
# Create benchmark questions
python scripts/create_benchmark_dataset.py

# Run comprehensive evaluation
python main.py benchmark
```

**What happens here:**
- Compares base model vs. fine-tuned model performance
- Uses multiple metrics: BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore
- Generates side-by-side response comparisons
- Saves detailed evaluation results

### Step 5: API Deployment

Finally, we deploy our assistant as a production-ready API:

```bash
# Start the API server
python main.py serve

# Test all endpoints
python scripts/test_api.py
```

**What happens here:**
- Loads the fine-tuned model into a FastAPI server
- Provides REST endpoints for predictions, health checks, and metrics
- Includes automatic API documentation
- Offers production-ready features like CORS, logging, and monitoring
